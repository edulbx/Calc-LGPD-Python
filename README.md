*Note: In these fields, numbers representing the quantity of recurrences/violated measures should be inserted.*

- **Specific Recidivism:** Refers to the repetition of an infraction by the same offender under the same legal or regulatory provision within a 5-year period, increasing the base value of the simple fine by 10% for each case of specific recidivism, up to 40%.
- **Generic Recidivism:** Refers to the commission of an infraction by the same offender, regardless of the legal or regulatory provision, within a 5-year period, increasing the base value of the simple fine by 5%, up to 20%.
